  Issues
      I had issues configuring and setting up my VMs.  After I was able to correct my errors I
    was I able to start collecting attacks.

  I was not able to collect any malware but all but one honeypot had results.
  Above I listed the total number of attacks as well as a a gif with my results.
  I had the VMs up over the course of the weekend to collect as much as possible 
  during the weekend and peak internet usage.  I spread my VM's locations to all 
  around the world to improve my exposure.  From the data collected I was able to
  familiarize myself with the types of attacks to look out for and what I can do to avoid 
  becoming a target myself.
  
  Questions?
  I tried to figure out why suricata didn't yield any results.  I tried again with different firewall settings and locations but none of my suricata VMs.  I had 1 running all weekend and 3 running for 5 hours on Sunday each with different locations.  I was also hoping to come across malware to see what was out there in 'the wild'.
